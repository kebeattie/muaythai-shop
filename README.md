# THAI KICK ECOMMERCE APP (PERN STACK)

PERN stack application. The app allows users to browse an online Muay Thai shop. If they wish to purchase any items they can register an account and sign in. Once signed in, they can add items to their cart. Orders are created when a user checks out their cart. Most of the features you can expect to find in any eccomerce app have been implemented, I have left some features out due to time limitations and the fact that this is just a personal projects (so it doesn't need to be production ready).
